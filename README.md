## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive images

### Continued development

I am looking forward to learn more about best practices in responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - As always, MDN has a great reference page about a topic: this helped my a lot to understand the concept of reponsive images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
